# My Assestment Project

This project focuses on evaluating and enhancing employer practices to optimize organizational performance and employee satisfaction. The assessment project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of current practices, identify areas for improvement, and recommend actionable strategies to align with organizational goals.

Actually this is my first assestment project so I'm so nervous, but I use all of what I learn for the past few months.

This assestment project duration is only 1 week or 7 days. Goodluck to me!

The website is all about Financial Advisor Service Website where you can book or talk to the Financial Adviser for your financial problem. But this site is not functional, the task they gave me for assestment is only for front end and design. They asked me to make a design using anu Javascript framework, with Home page, Services page and About page. I use ReactJS with Typescript for the entire site, I use Tailwind for designing the site. Feel free to give some feedback, thanks.
